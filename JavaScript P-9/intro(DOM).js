/* DOM (Document Object Model) :
The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.
It allows us to manipulate / change webpage content (HTML elements).

As we link our HTML page to JS , a tree like structured will be created.
Every page where HTML is used , document object will be generated automatically.
If we want to access the methods and the properties of document object we use "console.dir()" instead of "console.log".
