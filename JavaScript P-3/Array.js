//Push and Pop : we use push when we have to add a value or something inside the araay  in last.For example :  let arr = ["a","b","c","d"]; arr.push("e"); 
// We use Pop to remove last element from the array. 

/* And if we have to add the value to the start and remove it from start we'll use Unshift and Shift.
Unshift :We use it to add the value to  start of Array. 
Shift: Deletes the value from start and returns the array . */
