/* Find the errors in the following code.

let 1age = 5;
let 2age = 10;

The error in this code is that the variables cannot start with Number . so
the correct way of writing it will be 

let age1 = 5;
let age2 = 10;


b) let marks= 75;
let isPass = True;

in this the marks is declared correctly and isPass is not because writing True like this is not the correct way . we can write it like this true. 

c) let isPass = "true";

This is also not the correct way of writing because we are here declaring a boolean so we can write true without the quotes, which will gonna be the correct way.
